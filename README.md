This repo contains a working application, as an example for [the Haskell workshop](hanjoosten.github.com/HaskellWorkshop).


The code is in Main.hs. I didn't try to distribute it into multiple modules. Also, there are quite a few unused definitions in the file. They are there as examples of intermediate results while following the workshop. 

Have fun modifying it!
